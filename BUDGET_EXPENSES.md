TRONbet has already shown the power of wealth distribution and intends to continue generating wealth for its supportive community.  Below is a breakdown of how revenue derived from being a Super Representative will be redistributed:

90% redistributed back to voters proportional to the number of votes

10% will be kept by TRONbet development team to support server costs

In the near-future TRONbet will design a mechanism where votes will be tied in with mining ANTE tokens.  Keep a close eye on our Twitter and Telegram accounts for the most up-to-date information.
